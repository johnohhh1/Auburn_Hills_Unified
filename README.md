## 🔥 **The Vision Behind the Code**

As a **Managing Partner** at Chili's, I believe that **great leadership starts with great tools**. This isn't just another restaurant management system—this is a **complete operational ecosystem** born from the trenches of daily restaurant operations, designed by someone who lives and breathes the Chili's culture every single day.

### **The Story**
Every morning at 5:30 AM, I'm thinking about one thing: **How can I make my team more successful today?** Whether it's ensuring our daily operations run flawlessly, delegating effectively using our **ChiliHead Commitments**, or recognizing the incredible people who make our restaurant thrive—technology should amplify human excellence, not complicate it.

That's why I built this **Operations Hub**. Not because I had to, but because I **wanted to give my team the tools they deserve**.
